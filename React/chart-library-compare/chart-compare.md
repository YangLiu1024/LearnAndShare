# Compare React Chart Library

You can homebrew your charts in React without relying on any chart libray, however, considering the time you will need to spend developing and maintaining the code, its clear why a popular and well-maintained chart library for React is the way to go.

Then there come a question: which React chart library should we shoose?

In addition to the features a chart library provides, we should take into account

* the quality of documentation
* the impact on performance
* support interaction, support 3D, support Zoom/Brush
* library dependencies, library size
* the cost of license and support

## D3
D3 allow you to bind arbitrary data to a DOM, and then apply data-driven transformations to the document to create interactive SVG charts with smooth transitions and interaction.

Why not suggest use D3 in React directly:
1. Hard to learn and implement
2. D3 will manipulate the DOM directly, which conflict with React
