An *async* function is a function declared with the `async` keyword, and the `await` keyword is permitted within them. 

The async and await keywords enable asynchronous, promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner style, avoiding the need to explicitly configure promise chains.

```js
async function name(args) {
    statements
}
```
in *statements*, `await` maybe used, and can be used zero or more times. the return value for `async` function will be *Promise*.

`await` expression make promise-returning function behave as though they are synchronous by suspending execution until the returned promise is fulfilled ir rejected.

the resolved value of the promise is treated as the return value of the await expression.

the purpose of `async/await` is to simplify the syntax necessary to consume promise-based APIs. Code after each await expression can be thought of as existing in a `.then` callback. 

In this way a promise chain is progressively constructed with each reentrant step through the function. The return value forms the final link in the chain

```js
function resolveAfter2Seconds() {
  console.log("starting slow promise")
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    setTimeout(function() {
      resolve("slow")
      console.log("slow promise is done")
    }, 2000)
  })
}

function resolveAfter1Second() {
  console.log("starting fast promise")
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    setTimeout(function() {
      resolve("fast")
      console.log("fast promise is done")
    }, 1000)
  })
}

async function sequentialStart() {
  console.log('==SEQUENTIAL START==')

  // 1. Execution gets here almost instantly
  const slow = await resolveAfter2Seconds()
  console.log(slow) // 2. this runs 2 seconds after 1.

  const fast = await resolveAfter1Second()
  console.log(fast) // 3. this runs 3 seconds after 1.
}

async function concurrentStart() {
  console.log('==CONCURRENT START with await==');
  const slow = resolveAfter2Seconds() // starts timer immediately
  const fast = resolveAfter1Second() // starts timer immediately

  // 1. Execution gets here almost instantly
  console.log(await slow) // 2. this runs 2 seconds after 1.
  //in this way, even if fast promise reject before slow fulfilled, the control is still in concurrentStart
  console.log(await fast) // 3. this runs 2 seconds after 1., immediately after 2., since fast is already resolved
}

function concurrentPromise() {
  console.log('==CONCURRENT START with Promise.all==')
  return Promise.all([resolveAfter2Seconds(), resolveAfter1Second()]).then((messages) => {
    console.log(messages[0]) // slow
    console.log(messages[1]) // fast
  })
}

async function parallel() {
  console.log('==PARALLEL with await Promise.all==')

  // Start 2 "jobs" in parallel and wait for both of them to complete
  await Promise.all([
      (async()=>console.log(await resolveAfter2Seconds()))(),
      (async()=>console.log(await resolveAfter1Second()))()
  ])
}

sequentialStart() // after 2 seconds, logs "slow", then after 1 more second, "fast"

// wait above to finish
setTimeout(concurrentStart, 4000) // after 2 seconds, logs "slow" and then "fast"

// wait again
setTimeout(concurrentPromise, 7000) // same as concurrentStart

// wait again
setTimeout(parallel, 10000) // truly parallel: after 1 second, logs "fast", then after 1 more second, "slow"
```
